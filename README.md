# Tyrowo Inked
This is a repository containing the font I created based on my handwriting. 
I used to use notebooks for everything, so having my code editor display my handwriting was the end goal that I accomplished.

Used the Calligraphr.com app with pages of my handwriting to create the lettering.
Then iterated through versioning edits. Coupled with OFL licensing for public use.
Originally dubbed Tyro Inked, those previous versions can be found in the repository with a list of the updates.
This final version was created on Feb 1, 2021.

Now that I've used the font for a few years, the repository has been uploaded with my expressly given OFL Licensing, copyrighted on 12/12/2022. 
This is in the hopes that it will be able to be made publicly available as a contribution in the Google Fonts repository.
No RFN was chosen for the font intentionally to make this process go as easily as possible.
