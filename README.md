# Tyrowo Inked
This is a repository containing the font I created based on my handwriting. 
I used to use notebooks for everything, so having my code editor display my handwriting was the end goal that I accomplished.

I used the Calligraphr app with dozens of pages of my handwriting to create the lettering, and then iterated through versioning edits to tune it to my liking. 
Originally dubbed Tyro Inked, those previous versions can be found in the repository with a list of the updates.
This final version was created on Feb 1, 2021. However the metadata was changed from Tyro Inked to Tyrowo Inked at the time of this upload.

Now that I've used the font for a few years, the repository has been uploaded with my expressly given OFL Licensing for public use, copyrighted on 12/12/2022. 
This is in the hopes that it will be able to be made publicly available as a contribution to the Google Fonts repository.
No RFN was chosen for the font intentionally to make this process go as easily as possible.

For their use in creating my font I would like to thank 
Calligraphr for their font creator tool,
Aspose for their font metadata editing tool,
and CloudConvert for their file conversion tool.
